# Password Generator Application

This is a simple web-based application designed to help users generate passwords with customizable features. The project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, focusing on ease of use and responsive design.

## Features

- **Password Generation**: Users can select criteria to generate passwords with different styles (e.g., lowercase, uppercase, numbers, symbols).
- **Responsive Design**: The application adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Password Copying**: Easily copy the generated password to the clipboard with a single click.

## Project Structure

```
/
│-- index.html          # Main HTML file for the application
│-- css/
│   └── styles.css      # Custom CSS for styling the application
│-- js/
│   └── script.js       # JavaScript file for dynamic functionality
```

## How It Works

1. **Password Settings**: Users can select options for generating passwords, including character types and length.
2. **Password Generation**: When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, the application generates a password based on the selected options.
3. **Copy to Clipboard**: Users can copy the generated password by clicking the copy icon. The icon changes temporarily to indicate successful copying.
4. **Password Length Slider**: Users can adjust the length of the generated password using a slider.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Provides the structure and layout of the application.
- **CSS3**: Custom styles for enhancing the visual appeal, including Google Fonts and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Handles dynamic DOM manipulation, password generation logic, and clipboard operations.
